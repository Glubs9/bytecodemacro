requirements:
	- I have only tested this on wsl debian but there should be no problems running this on any other os.
	- you need python3.9 to be installed for this to work, as this library deals with low level details of
	  the python installation it is very sensitive to different python versions. Although I don't see why
	  it wouldn't work on previous versions, if you are encountering errors please first check
	  that you are running on python 3.9.0 (the only version i have currently tested it on).
	  to check your python version run python3 --version
	- make sure you are using cpython, this will only work with cpython. If you are unsure of
	  what python installation you are using, it is probably cpython.

install:
python3 -m pip install bytecodemacro
