alright so this is the current theory

meta takes two files (maybe strings), one being the source file and the other being the macros file

added syntax
	- quote for literal strings that are directly put into the source
	- compile which compiles a given string and converts it to bytecode
	- to specify which sections of source will be macro'd we can put delimiters either side with
	the function we want to macro around it
		- if multiple layers then we should be able to do inner first

think of a use for macros that isn't added syntax
	- i really like that idea on stack optimizaitons
